# entang_complex
A computational study of qubits systems; from the complexity of the problem emerges a property called "quantum frustration".

The codes in this repository evaluate the purity of a qubit for the random pure state of a couple of qubits.

# continuous and discrete states distintion
Quantum states are classified as "continuous" if taken in a completely random way and as "discrete" if having the coefficients equal to + or - 1, up to a normalization constant.
